2. **Waveform-to-Geometry Mapping** - Projects audio data onto cylindrical surfaces
3. **Interactive 3D Visualization** - WebGL-based real-time preview with Three.js
4. **STL Generation** - 3D-printable file output for ceramic manufacturing
5. **Physical Realization** - Porcelain 3D printing and glazing

## Technical Architecture

### Backend: Python/Flask Signal Processing Pipeline

**Core Technologies:**
- **Flask** - Web framework with session management
- **NumPy/SciPy** - Scientific computing for FFT and signal processing
- **Matplotlib** - Real-time graph generation (frequency analysis, waveforms)
- **numpy-stl** - 3D mesh generation and STL file creation
- **MySQL** - User data and sculpture parameter persistence

**Signal Processing Algorithm:**

The core algorithm begins with FFT analysis to extract frequency characteristics from the audio data. The system normalizes the audio signal and applies a real FFT to identify dominant frequencies. This dominant frequency is used to determine the base wavelength, to align the geometric layers.

The cylindrical coordinate mapping transforms the 1D audio waveform into 3D space: each audio cycle becomes a horizontal layer in the vase, with the waveform amplitude directly controlling the radial displacement from the base cylinder.

The texture generation process samples the audio data at calculated intervals, averaging amplitude values to create smooth surface variations. This approach ensures that the resulting 3D geometry accurately represents the audio characteristics while maintaining manufacturable surface topology.

### Frontend: JavaScript/Three.js 3D Visualization

**Technologies:**
- **Three.js** - WebGL-based 3D graphics engine
- **STLLoader** - Real-time STL file loading and rendering
- **OrbitControls** - Interactive camera manipulation
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - DOM manipulation and UI state management

**Real-time 3D Features:**
- **Interactive camera controls** (orbit, zoom, pan)
- **Material simulation** with transparency and metallic properties
- **Responsive design** with dynamic viewport resizing
- **Live parameter updates** without page refresh

### Database Schema

The system uses a MySQL database with two primary tables for user management and sculpture persistence. The user table stores encrypted credentials and session information, while the sculptures table maintains all parameter configurations for each generated vase. This design enables users to save and revisit their creations while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Audio Processing** | Real-time | FFT analysis and waveform mapping |
| **3D Generation** | <5 seconds | STL file creation for complex geometries |
| **WebGL Rendering** | 60 FPS | Interactive 3D visualization |
| **File Size Optimization** | 90% reduction | STL compression for web delivery |
| **User Session Management** | Persistent | Multi-user support with guest mode |

## Core Technical Innovations

### Adaptive Frequency Detection

The system implements intelligent frequency analysis that can either:
- **Automatically detect** the dominant frequency using FFT peak analysis
- **Manually specify** frequency for precise artistic control, adjusting from the detected frequency.

The automatic detection algorithm scans the frequency domain for the highest amplitude peak within the audible range, providing intelligent defaults for users unfamiliar with audio analysis. Manual frequency specification enables precise artistic control for users who understand the relationship between frequency and visual texture.

### Cylindrical Waveform Mapping

The core innovation maps 1D audio waveforms onto 3D cylindrical surfaces through mathematical transformation:

1. **Frequency-based resolution calculation** - Determines surface detail based on audio characteristics
2. **Layer-by-layer texture generation** - Each audio cycle becomes a horizontal layer
3. **Radial displacement mapping** - Waveform amplitude directly controls surface displacement
4. **Seamless cylindrical wrapping** - Ensures continuous surface topology

### Real-time Parameter Optimization

The system provides 7 key parameters for artistic control:

- **Height** - Number of audio cycles (layers)
- **Radius** - Base cylinder diameter
- **Layer Height** - Vertical spacing between cycles
- **Per Revolution** - Waveforms per complete rotation
- **Depth** - Texture amplitude multiplier
- **Frequency** - Base frequency for layer alignment
- **Auto Frequency** - Automatic frequency detection
